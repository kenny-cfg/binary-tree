# Binary Tree implementation

## Need to implement

* Node
    * Value
    * Left node (originally have None value)
    * Right node (originally have None value)

* Binary search tree
    * First inserted node will be the root node
    * Subsequent nodes will have to traverse the tree until an empty node container is found
      * If the value is less than the current node's value, traverse left
      * If the value is greater than or equal to the current node's value, traverse right
